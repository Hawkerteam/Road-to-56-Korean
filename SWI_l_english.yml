 SWI_geistige_desc:0 "1935년, 프리츠 하우저 의원은 어떻게 우리나라의 정신적 독립을 파시스트들과 공산주의자들로부터 지킬지 조사를 시작했습니다. 조사의 결과로 그는 자유, 민주주의, 자결권, 그리고 균형잡힌 정부를 골자로 하는 가이스티게 란데스페르타이디궁, 다른 말로 정신적 국방을 제의했습니다. 우리는 최대한 빨리 이 제의를 받아들여야 합니다."
 SWI_richtlinienbewegung:0 "원칙 운동 지원"
 SWI_richtlinienbewegung_desc:0 "엘리트들은 나라를 망쳤으며 1929년의 대공황으로 우리 경제가 무너진 상황에서도 산적한 문제들을 해결하는 데에 실패했습니다. 이제 극좌와 극우의 독수리 떼들이 우리 주변을 빙빙 돌고 있으며, 우리나라를 그들의 날개로 채가려 하고 있습니다! 더 이상 이렇게 되서는 안됩니다. 우리는 국민들을 도우면서도 자유를 포기하지 않는 새로운 동맹을 만들어야 합니다!"
 SWI_burger:0 "시민 연합 지원"
 SWI_burger_desc:0 "우리는 사회주의라는 악의 희생양이 되어서는 안됩니다! 그 대신 회복을 향한 우리의 길을 계속 가기 위해 우리는 보수주의자들과 농민들의 연합에 기대를 걸어야 합니다. 우리는 정부가 급진화되도록 놔둬서는 안됩니다."

 SWI_prepare:0 "전쟁 준비"

 SWI_stock:0 "의무적인 비축"
 SWI_stock_desc:0 "이제부터 스위스에 있는 모든 회사는 최소한 6개월 치의 비축량을 가지고 있어야 하며, 아니면 수입 면허가 취소될 것입니다. 이를 통해 전쟁이 발발했을 때 약간의 물자를 더 확보할 수 있을 것입니다."

 SWI_wahlen_desc:0 "스위스의 경지 면적을 얼마 되지 않으며, 있는 것의 대부분도 귀중한 경지를 너무 많이 차지하는 소 목축에 낭비되고 있습니다. 우리는 늪지를 메우고, 숲을 개간하고, 목초지를 밀과 감자 농장으로 바꿔야 합니다."
 SWI_shadow:0 "그림자 단체"

 SWI_modern_at_weapons:0 "현대식 대전차 무기"
 SWI_modern_at_weapons_desc:0 "우리는 1930년대 초에 이미 대전차 소총을 개발했습니다. 이제 우리는 소총이 발사할 수 있는 화망을 늘리거나 관통력을 향상시키기 위해 탄환의 구경을 키워야 합니다."
 SWI_stop_export:0 "폐품 거래 중단"
 SWI_stop_export_desc:0 "오랫동안 스위스는 다른 나라들에 상태가 괜찮은 폐품을 제련용으로 제공했습니다. 하지만 이제 우리나라는 그 고철을 필요로 합니다. 바티칸 시국을 제외한 나머지 모든 나라와의 폐품 거래를 우리는 중단할 것입니다."
 SWI_agri:0 "농업적 발전"
 SWI_agri_desc:0 "국토의 대부분이 산지인 우리나라가 식량 자급을 약간이나마 달성하기 위해서는 상당한 창의성이 필요했습니다. 이는 자연스럽게 생산 및 농업 기술의 발전으로 이어졌으며, 그중 상당수는 다른 분야에도 적용할 수 있습니다."

 SWI_international:0 "국제 관계"
 SWI_international_desc:0 "작은 국토 면적과 인구에도 불구하고, 스위스는 사실 국제 무대에서 상당히 중요한 나라입니다. 우리는 적십자의 발상지이자 믿을만한 중립국이고 우리 은행은 세계적으로 유명합니다. 이를 활용하지 않는 것은 어리석은 짓일 것입니다."

 SWI_chemical_desc:0 "자연 세계에 대한 이해가 심화되면서, 우리는 석유 수입에 대한 필요를 크게 줄일 수 있게 해주는 대체 연료를 만드는 방법에 대한 중요한 발견을 했습니다. 우리는 이 합성 물질을 최대한 많이 생산할 수 있도록 만들어야 하며, 다행히도 우리는 공장을 짓기에 딱 알맞은 부지를 가지고 있습니다."
 SWI_fuel_ration:0 "연료 배급제"
 SWI_fuel_ration_desc:0 "몇몇 필수적인 직책을 제외한 나머지 시민들은 운전이 금지될 것이고, 연료는 비축되어야 하며, 난방은 최대한 목재를 사용해야 할 것입니다. 우리는 석유를 수입에 완전히 의존하고 있으며 대체재를 찾는 동안 우리가 가진 것을 필수적인 목적을 위해 비축해야 합니다."

 SWI_bicycle_infantry_desc:0 "연료 사용을 피하기 위해 자전거를 활용함으로써 우리 병력에게 어느 정도의 기동성을 우리는 줄 수 있을 것입니다. 우리는 이미 자전거를 대전차 무기 견인에 사용했으며, 따라서 충분한 자전거만 있으면 중대한 개혁이 필요하지는 않을 것입니다."

 SWI_corporatism:0 "조합주의의 부상"
 SWI_corporatism_desc:0 "스위스는 국민들을 돌보지도 못하는 비참한 국가가 되었습니다. 이 약점은 우리 정부의 약점에서 기인하는 것입니다. 이 정부는 파괴되고 더 짜임새 있는 조직으로 대체되어야 하며, 새로운 정부는 국민과 국가의 요구에 더 잘 대처할 수 있을 것입니다."

 SWI_irredentism_desc:0 "1919년 포어아를베르크의 주민들은 우리 연방의 형제들과 합병하기로 투표했습니다. 하지만 자본가들과 우리의 나약한 지도자들이 이를 받아들이지 않았습니다! 이는 말도 안되는 일이며 그들은 우리나라의 국민입니다! 우리는 우리 것을 되찾을 것이며, 잃어버린 시간에 대한 보상으로 더 많은 것을 챙길 것입니다!"
 SWI_new_mil:0 "상비군"

 SWI_join_italy:0 "Roman Association"
 SWI_join_italy_desc:0 "For all of our ties to the germans, we share almost as many with the italians, and they do not have as many... objectionable policies.

 SWI_ger_tech_desc:0 "The Germans have truly outdone themselves in terms of research and development, creating a finely tuned war machine that even their gretest enemies respect. German science is the best in the world, and we would do well to emulate their practices."
 SWI_join_allies:0 "Formal French Alliance"
 SWI_join_allies_desc:0 "Historically we have been on very good terms with the French, even coming up with joint plans should our country ever be attacked. New situations in the world however have caused us to wonder if perhaps we would best be served in an official alliance with France."
 SWI_french_tech:0 "French Technological Cooperation"
 SWI_french_tech_desc:0 "The French did not win the Great War through pur luck. On their side were scientists and researchers. The British and French may have both developed tanks to cross the trenches, but the French were the ones whose design has become the template for so many tanks produced even now.

 SWI_army:0 "Review the Military"

 SWI_end_con_desc:0 "Until now conscription has served our country well, but times have changed and that method will no longer work. Instead, we must work towards a more modern professional army.

 SWI_con_to_army:0 "Institute a Draft"
 SWI_con_to_army_desc:0 "In order for us to have a standing army, we must first have men to serve in that army. We already have people on record as ready to serve. Well, it is time for them to serve."
 SWI_improve_con:0 "Improved Militia Training"
 SWI_improve_con_desc:0 "The army relies implicitly on the militia, and we cannot allow them to be anything but the best. Training needs to cover every possible situation so that our men can fight in any situation at any time."
